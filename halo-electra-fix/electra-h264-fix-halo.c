/* electra-h264-fix -- make UE5's Electra play H.264 under D3DMetal.
 *
 * Three faults in a row, each hiding the next. Found by instrumenting the game
 * rather than reasoning about it -- four earlier attempts, all argued from
 * resemblance to another title, changed nothing because they acted downstream
 * of a decoder that never started. The probe this grew from is kept at
 * diagnostics/electra-probe.c and its logs are what every claim here rests on.
 *
 * 1. CrossOver's winegstreamer censors NV12 from
 *    transform_GetOutputAvailableType whenever it detects macOS; the strings
 *    sit adjacent in the shipping DLL and is_macos() is the only guard. The
 *    decoder then offers YV12, YV12, IYUV, I420, YUY2 and nothing else, while
 *    Electra's H.264 decoder accepts NV12 and nothing else -- so it walks that
 *    list, finds nothing, and destroys the decoder before a frame exists.
 *    Handing NV12 back by name is enough: the censoring is only in the getter,
 *    and SetOutputType validates against an array that still holds it.
 *
 * 2. Electra decides whether decoding is in software by asking its OWN
 *    platform handle, never the decoder -- so withholding the D3D manager from
 *    the MFT, which seemed obvious, could never have worked. Because
 *    winegstreamer still advertises MF_SA_D3D_AWARE, Electra builds itself a
 *    D3D11 device, answers "not software", and takes a branch demanding
 *    IMFDXGIBuffer on the output buffer, which no system-memory buffer can
 *    satisfy. Every frame is dropped in silence.
 *
 * 3. The same gate decides the frame height. Patch one call site and not the
 *    other and the renderer is handed a luma-only picture, so both go.
 *
 * winevideo reaches the same place by patching winegstreamer itself (its patch
 * 0005). This is that effect from inside the process: one game, reversible,
 * nothing outside the game folder touched.
 *
 * Offsets are checked against the bytes that should be there before anything
 * is written. A game update moves them, and then this does nothing and says so
 * rather than corrupting whatever it landed in.
 *
 * NOT for a game with anti-cheat or anti-tamper: it patches a running process.

/* Make Electra take its software path, by changing its mind rather than the

 *
 * Electra does not ask the MFT whether decoding is in software -- withholding
 * SET_D3D_MANAGER was therefore useless. It asks its OWN platform handle,
 * IsSoftware(), and because CrossOver's winegstreamer still advertises
 * MF_SA_D3D_AWARE it has already built itself a D3D11 device and answers no.
 * It then takes the branch that requires IMFDXGIBuffer on the output buffer,
 * which a system-memory buffer can never satisfy, and drops every frame
 * without ever reaching the IMF2DBuffer query we hooked.
 *
 * winevideo reaches the same end by patching winegstreamer to report no D3D
 * awareness on macOS (patch 0005, "UE ElectraPlayer takes its software decode
 * path on macOS"). From inside the process the equivalent is to answer the two
 * questions Electra actually asks:
 *
 *   1. the console variable that selects the upload-heap path -> 1, so the
 *      decoder stores the sample and queries nothing
 *   2. IsSoftware() -> true at both call sites, so the consumer takes the
 *      branch that accepts a plain buffer
 *
 * The second site is not optional. If the renderer reports D3D11 the outer
 * gate is false, DecodedHeight stays at the frame height instead of one and a
 * half times it, and the renderer is handed a luma-only frame.
 *
 * Offsets are from the disassembly of this exact executable, so every one is
 * verified against the bytes that should be there before anything is written.
 * A game update moves them, and then this must do nothing rather than corrupt
 * something. */
